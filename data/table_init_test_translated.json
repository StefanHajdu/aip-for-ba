It consists of 9 rows and 7 columns.\n\n**Columns:**\n\n1. **statistic**: A string column containing the type of statistic measured (e.g., \"count\", \"null_count\", etc.)\n2. **Rok**: A floating-point number column representing the year of measurement (values range from approximately 2015 to 2022)\n3. **Monitorovacia_stani**: A string column with a unique value for each row (appears to be an identifier or location)\n4. **L\u00e1tka**: A string column containing the type of substance or variable being measured (e.g., \"Benz\u00e9n*\", \"pr\u00edzemn\u00fd oz\u00f3n*\")\n5. **Hodnota**: A string column representing the measured value of the substance or variable (values range from 0.35 to 928)\n6. **ObjectId**: A floating-point number column containing an identifier or key (values range from approximately -238 to 238)\n7. **ObjectId2**: A floating-point number column with a unique value for each row, possibly representing another identifier or measurement (values range from approximately 1 to 238)\n\n**Values and Ranges:**\n\n* **Rok**: values in the year range 2015-2022\n* **Hodnota**: string values ranging from 0.35 to 928\n* **ObjectId**: floating-point numbers with a range of approximately -238 to 238\n* **ObjectId2**: floating-point numbers with a range of approximately 1 to 238\n\n**Notable Observations:**\n\n* The \"Monitorovacia_stani\" column has a unique value for each row, suggesting it could be used as an identifier or key.\n* The \"L\u00e1tka\" column contains variables like \"Benz\u00e9n*\" and \"pr\u00edzemn\u00fd oz\u00f3n*\", which may indicate the presence of pollutants or environmental hazards in the data.\n* The \"Hodnota\" column contains measured values for these substances, with a range from 0.35 to 928, suggesting varying levels of contamination.\n* The \"ObjectId\" and \"ObjectId2\" columns contain unique identifiers, possibly used for tracking measurements over time.\n\nPlease note that without more context or information about the dataset's origin, it is difficult to provide a more detailed interpretation of these findings.", "source": null, "table": "https://services8.arcgis.com/pRlN1m0su5BYaFAS/ArcGIS/rest/services/Emisie_z\u00e1kladn\u00fdch_zne\u010dis\u0165uj\u00facich_l\u00e1tok_pod\u013ea_monitorovac\u00edch_stan\u00edc_od_roku_2017/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=*&returnGeometry=false&outSR=&f=json"}, {"title": "Air pollution according to the operator and emissions.", "description": "Here is a description of the dataset:\n\n**Dataset Overview**\n\nThis dataset has 9 rows and 8 columns, indicating a relatively small-sized dataset. The column names suggest that it contains information about some kind of industrial or environmental statistics.\n\n**Columns**\n\n1. **statistic**: This column appears to contain various statistical metrics for each entry, such as count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, 25%, and 75%. (Type: str)\n2. **Rok**: This column contains integer values representing years, with a minimum of 2013 and a maximum of 2022. (Type: f64)\n3. **Prev\u00e1dzkov**: This column appears to contain names or descriptions related to industrial sources or facilities. The values are string-based and include company names like \"BIONERGY, a.s.\" and \"Volkswagen, s.r.o.\". (Type: str)\n4. **Okres**: This column contains string values representing districts or regions, with the value \"Bratislava\" appearing multiple times. (Type: str)\n5. **Typ**: This column contains string-based categorical values related to types of emissions or pollutants, such as \"Zne\u010dis\u0165ovanie\", \"ovzdu\u0161ia oxidmi...\", and others. (Type: str)\n6. **Emisie__t**: This column contains float values representing emission levels, with a minimum value of 0.99 and a maximum value of 3316.1. The mean is approximately 407.61, and the standard deviation is around 759.55. (Type: f64)\n7. **ObjectId**: This column appears to contain unique identifiers for some industrial facilities or sources, with a minimum value of 0.0 and a maximum value of 62.0. There are only two non-null values in this column. (Type: f64)\n8. **ObjectId2**: This column is identical to the \"ObjectId\" column, suggesting that it may be an error or redundancy. (Type: f64)\n\n**Value Ranges**\n\n* The \"Rok\" column ranges from 2013 to 2022.\n* The \"Emisie__t\" column ranges from 0.99 to 3316.1.\n* The \"ObjectId\" and \"ObjectId2\" columns range from 0.0 to 62.0.\n\n**Missing Values**\n\nThe dataset has a relatively low number of missing values (null_count), with only one null value in the entire dataset, specifically for the \"Prev\u00e1dzkov\" column.", "source": null, "table": "https://services8.arcgis.com/pRlN1m0su5BYaFAS/ArcGIS/rest/services/Zne\u010dis\u0165ovanie_ovzdu\u0161ia_pod\u013ea_prev\u00e1dzkovate\u013ea_a_emisi\u00ed/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&outFields=*&returnGeometry=false&outSR=&f=json"}]
