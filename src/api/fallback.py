	"llm_answer": "Action:Based on the provided dataset, which contains emissions of primary air pollutants according to monitoring stations placed in Bratislava city districts since 2017, and your question about finding the worst place to live based on the data, I analyzed the information.\n\nHowever, due to the lack of direct information about emissions or pollutant levels for each district, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific \"worst\" place. Nevertheless, considering the provided dataset description, I found that the monitoring station at Trnavské mýto has recorded a high value (1286.0) in 2018.\n\nTherefore, my answer is that the worst place to live based on the available data appears to be Trnavské mýto in Bratislava, with a significant pollutant level measured in 2018.",
